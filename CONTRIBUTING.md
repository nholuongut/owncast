# Help contribute to Owncast!

Owncast is a growing open source project that is giving freedom, flexibility and fun to live streamers.
And while we have a small team of kind, talented and thoughtful volunteers, we have gaps in our skillset that we’d love to fill so we can get even better at building tools that make a difference for people.

We abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://owncast.online/contribute/) and feel strongly about open, appreciative, and empathetic people joining us.
We’ve been very lucky to have this so far, so maybe you can help us with your skills and passion, too!

There is a larger, more detailed, and more up-to-date [guide for helping contribute to Owncast on our website](https://owncast.online/help/).
